__The "linear representation hypothesis" in language models suggests that high\-level semantic concepts are represented as directions in a model's representation space\. This implies that understanding and manipulating these concepts might be achieved by moving along these directions\. For example\, if a model understands the concept of "gender\," it might represent "king" and "queen" as points in a space where the difference between them is a linear direction corresponding to the concept of "gender"\. __
